.SH NAME
rotegrity - make rotegrity and nexorede models
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rotegrity
[\fI\,options\/\fR] [\fI\,input_file\/\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Read a file in OFF format containing a roughly spherical polyhedron, or
previously twisted model, and try to convert into a rotegrity or nexorade.
Units keep original edge colours. If input_file is not given the program
reads from standard input.

.IP
or X (default: t)
.HP
\fB\-O\fR <type> output type for units: full (face), rotegrity (3 short struts),
.IP
nexorade (long strut), Nexorade (long strut, direction vertices)
(default: full). Only 'full' output can be used as input with
option \fB\-t\fR

\fB\-m\fR <maps> a comma separated list of colour maps used to transform colour
.IP
indexes (default: rand), a part consisting of letters from
v, e, f, selects the element types to apply the map list to
(default 'vef')
.HP
\fB\-c\fR <type> colouring type: edge (base model edges), symmetry, unit
.IP
(according to shape), none (default: edge)
.HP
\fB\-s\fR <perc> percentage to adjust corrections on iteration (default: 98)
.HP
\fB\-n\fR <itrs> maximum number of iterations, \fB\-1\fR for unlimited (default: 10000)

negative exponent (default: 15 giving 1e\-15)
.HP
\fB\-z\fR <nums> number of iterations between status reports (implies termination
.IP

followed by a comma and the number of iterations between
termination checks (0 for report checks only) (default: 1000,1)
.HP
\fB\-o\fR <file> write output to file (default: write to standard output)
