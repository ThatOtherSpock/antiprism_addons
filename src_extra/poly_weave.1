.SH NAME
poly_weave - weave based on a polyhedron
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B poly_weave
[\fI\,options\/\fR] [\fI\,input_file\/\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Read a file in OFF format and make a weave following a specified pattern.
The polyhedron faces are divided by a 'meta' operation into triangles
each having vertices which are a vertex V, edge centre E and face centre F.
A start point is positioned on one of these triangles, the next point is
found by using the pattern to step between triangles, leading to a circuit.
Intermediate points may be added along the steps to help with the weave.
If input_file is not given the program reads from standard input.

Barycentric coords V,E,F of initial point (default 0,1,0)

by 0 to 3 coordinates for 'up' (def: 0), 'side' (def: 0),
\&'along' (def: equal spacing)
