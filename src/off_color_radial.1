\fB\-l\fR <lim>
minimum distance change to terminate planarization, as negative

Scene Options
.TP
\fB\-d\fR <opt>
coloring. radial=1, axes=2 (default: 1)
.IP
(multiple \fB\-d\fR as needed)
.HP
\fB\-a\fR <ax,p> axis order. primary=1, secondary=2, tertiary=3, all=4 (default: 1)
.IP
p is percent length of the axis. (default: 100 percent)
(multiple \fB\-a\fR as needed)
.HP
\fB\-f\fR <list> specify a list of elements, list starts with element letter,
.IP
followed by an index number list, given as index ranges separated
by commas. range can be one number or two numbers separated by a
hyphen (default range numbers: 0 and largest index).
Index number list will be preceded by f, e, v for faces, edges and
vertices. Elements resolve to connected faces to be staring point
for radial coloring. special selector: s for number of face sides
.IP
(multiple \fB\-f\fR as needed, \fB\-f\fR overrides \fB\-a\fR)
.TP
\fB\-s\fR <sym>
symmetry subgroup (Schoenflies notation)

Coloring Options (run 'off_util \fB\-H\fR color' for help on color formats)
keyword: none \- sets no color
.TP
\fB\-E\fR <col>
color the edges according to: (default: unchanged)
.IP
a color value \- apply to all edges
f \- color with average adjacent face color
.TP
\fB\-V\fR <col>
color the vertices according to: (default: unchanged)
.IP
a color value \- apply to all vertices
e \- color with average adjacent edge color
f \- color with average adjacent face color
.TP
\fB\-T\fR <t,e>
transparency. from 0 (invisible) to 255 (opaque). element is any
or all of, v \- vertices, e \- edges, f \- faces, a \- all (default: f)
.HP
\fB\-m\fR <maps> a comma separated list of color maps used to transform color
.IP
indexes (default: rng), a part consisting of letters from
v, e, f, selects the element types to apply the map list to
(default 'vef'). use map name of 'index' to output index numbers
.IP
calculated maps: rng, rainbow, gray, grayw, spread, rnd, deal
e.g rng will become rngN where N is the number of ridges found
.TP
\fB\-c\fR s,t,n
control map stepping for calculated maps. positive or 0.
.IP
s \- shift, t \- step, n \- map size (default: 0,1,(calculated))
.TP
\fB\-r\fR
use the face map in reverse order
.HP
\fB\-n\fR <maps> color maps for axes (A=1: calculated, A=2: axes)
.TP
\fB\-A\fR <opt>
color axes by nfold=1, order=2 (default: 1)
