.SH NAME
poly_form - make face-regular and unscramble models
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B poly_form
[\fI\,options\/\fR] [\fI\,input_file\/\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Read a file in OFF format containing a graph of a polyhedron, with or
without vertex coordinates, and try to create a spherical or ellipsoidal
tesselation where the maximum edge is a minimum length, or try to make
into a regular\-faced polyhedron. Option adjustment factors expressed as
a percentage are approximate. If input_file is not given the program reads
from standard input.

.HP
\fB\-\-version\fR version information
.TP
\fB\-a\fR <alg>
model forming algorithm
r \- make faces into unit\-edged regular polygons (default)
u \- unscramble: place a small polygon on one side of a
.IP
sphere or ellipsoid and the rest of the vertices at a
point on the other side, then equalise shortest and
longest edges attached to a vertex
.IP
U \- equalise shortest and longest edges attached to a vertex
.IP
on sphere or ellipsoid (use to continue unscrambling)
.IP
e \- equalise edges on sphere or ellipsoid (default)
p \- planarise
.HP
\fB\-n\fR <itrs> maximum number of iterations, \fB\-1\fR for unlimited (default: 10000)
.HP
\fB\-s\fR <perc> percentage to shorten longest edges on iteration (default: 1)
.HP
\fB\-k\fR <perc> \fB\-a\fR r \- percentage to reduce polygon radius on iteration
.IP
(default: value of \fB\-s\fR)
.IP
\fB\-a\fR e \- percentage to reduce minimum target length on iteration
.IP
(default: 1e\-6), will oscillate at certain precision,
process output with smaller value to improve solution
.HP
\fB\-f\fR <perc> percentage to reduce distance of vertex from face plane (\fB\-a\fR rp)
.IP
on iteration (default: value of \fB\-s\fR)
.TP
\fB\-y\fR
maintain symmetry of the base model (with \fB\-a\fR e/r/p)
.HP
\fB\-E\fR <prms> use ellipsoid, three numbers separated by commas are the
.IP
axis lengths (for a superellipsoid an optional fourth number
gives the power)
.TP
\fB\-l\fR <lim>
minimum change of distance/width_of_model to terminate, as
.IP
negative exponent (default: 14 giving 1e\-14)
.HP
\fB\-z\fR <nums> number of iterations between status reports (implies termination
.IP
check) (0 for final report only, \fB\-1\fR for no report), optionally
followed by a comma and the number of iterations between
termination checks (0 for report checks only) (default: 1000,100)
.HP
\fB\-o\fR <file> write output to file (default: write to standard output)
