.SH NAME
zono - zonohedra from OFF files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B zono
[\fI\,options\/\fR] [\fI\,star_file\/\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Make a zonohedron or add zones to a convex seed polyhdron. The zones are
created from a star of vectors, which can be based on a polyhdron (input
model and option \fB\-m\fR) or initialised (option \fB\-P\fR) to make a polar zonohedron.
If input_file is not given the program reads from standard input

centroid (default '0,0,0')

.TP
\fB\-P\fR <arg>
polar zonohedron from ordered star, arg can be an offset polygon
given as an integer or fraction (e.g. 5, 7/2) or 's' to use
star_file. Optionally, follow by a comma and an integer to
to make a spirallohedron with that spiral width (default:0, a
polar zonohedron). Any further comma separated parts are colour
maps to colour the faces.
.HP
\fB\-T\fR <star> translation surface made from two ordered stars (argument star
.IP
and star_file) optionally followed by a comma and two characters
(or one to use for both) to indicate if the stars of vectors
are open, or close to form a loop: d\-detect, c\-force close,
.IP
o\-leave open.
.HP
\fB\-o\fR <file> write output to file (default: write to standard output)
