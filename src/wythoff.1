.SH NAME
wythoff - Wythoff-style constructions
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B wythoff
[\fI\,options\/\fR] [\fI\,input_file\/\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Read a file in OFF format and apply a specified pattern to generate polygon
tiles. The polyhedron faces are divided by a 'meta' operation into triangles
each having vertices which are a vertex V, edge centre E and face centre F.
A start point is positioned on one of these triangles, the next point is
found by using the pattern to step between triangles, leading to a circuit.
If input_file is not given the program reads from standard input.

pattern in form: [Coords0:Coords1:...]Path0,Path1...
Coordinates are barycentric, in form aVbEcF:
.IP
VEF element letters, and a,b,c are barycentric coordinates
corresponding to the following element letter. Ommiting a
an element letter and coordinate sets the coordinate to zero.
Ommitting just the coordinate sets the coordinate to 1. E.g
.IP
V = (1,0,0), VE = (1,1,0), V2E3F = (1,2,3)
Paths are in the form: TrisPidx0Move0Pidx1Move1...
.IP
Tris: one of +\-* (default +) indicating that paths should
.IP
start for positive, negative or both kinds of triangles.
.IP
Pidx: an index number of a point from the coordinates list
Move: an operation for stepping to the next triangle, given
.IP
as a series of characters from the following:
.TP
_
\- no move, stay on the same triangle
.IP
v,e,f \- step over side opposite V,E,F
V,E,F \- step two trianglesi, rotating about V,E,F,
.IP
according to: V=ef, E=fv, F=ve
.IP
Paths can start or end with either a move or a point
.TP
\fB\-c\fR <op>
Conway polyhedron notation operator, or 'list' to list all
available operators with their corresponding patterns
.TP

reverse pattern, exchanges the signs of the start triangles
.HP
\fB\-r\fR <elms> relabel pattern, exactly three letters VEF written in any order
.IP
e.g. EFV relabels the pattern as V\->E,v\->e,E\->F,e\->f,F\->V,f\->v

.IP
Tile colouring methods
.IP
none \- do not colour tiles
index \- use the path index, and apply colormap (default)
association \- colour tiles using corresponding base element
.IP
colour, optionally followed by a comma and a letter from V,
E, F, or a colour, to use for all local tiles (default: F)
.IP
Point colouring methods (default: use tile coloring method)
.IP
none \- do not colour points
index \- use the point index, and apply colormap
association \- colour points using corresponding base element
.IP
colour, optionally followed by a comma and a letter from V,
E, F, or a colour, to use for all local points (default: F)
.IP
component \- colour by non\-zero components, V=1, E=2, F=4,
.IP
V&E=3, E&F=6, V&F=5, V&E&F=7, and apply colormap
.IP
weight \- colour using barycentric coordinates as RGB
.HP
\fB\-m\fR <maps> a comma separated list of colour maps used to transform colour
.IP
indexes (default: spread), a part consisting of letters from
v, e, f, selects the element types to apply the map list to
.TP
\fB\-u\fR
output only one example of each type of tile (one per path)
.TP
\fB\-a\fR

.TP
\fB\-f\fR <ht>

.TP
\fB\-q\fR
quiet, don't print report
.HP
\fB\-o\fR <file> write output to file (default: write to standard output)
