.SH SYNOPSIS
.B poly_kscope
[\fI\,options\/\fR] [\fI\,input_file\/\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
A polyhedral kaleidoscope. Read a file in OFF format and repeat it
in a symmetric arrangement like a kaleidoscope. If input_file is
not given the program reads from standard input.

.TP
\fB\-s\fR <sym>
(required) symmetry type for kaleidoscope, up to three comma
separated parts: main symmetry (Schoenflies notation) or file name,
subgroup (Schoenflies notation), and conjugation type (integer)
.TP
\fB\-y\fR <arg>
make a compound by aligning the component to match a subsymmetry
with the kaleidoscope. Argument is either 'list' (to print the
list of the compounds to standard output) or a number from the
list optionally followed by a comma and realignment (colon
separated list of an integer then decimal numbers)
.HP
\fB\-c\fR <elms> color elements with a different index number for each part. The
.IP
element string can include v, e and f to color, respectively,
vertices, edges and faces
.HP
\fB\-m\fR <maps> a comma separated list of colour maps used to transform colour
.IP
indexes (default: rand), a part consisting of letters from
v, e, f, selects the element types to apply the map list to
(default 'vef'). The 'compound' map should give useful results.
