======
Antiprism includes a number of built in models. These may be used by
any program that expects an OFF file, by passing the model name instead
of a file name e.g. antiview u1. Adding _d to a resource model name will
give the dual of the model. Prefixing std_ to a resource name will give
an uncoloured standard or usual representation of the polyhedron.

const char *help_uniform = R"(Uniform Polyhedra
=================
Uniform polyhedra can be specified by

o   A U number e.g. u8

o   u_ followed by the specific Wythoff Symbol in the list below,
    e.g. 'u_2 4|3', which will be used as a lookup for the
    corresponding uniform

o   wythoff_ followed by a general Wythoff Symbol, where '_' and ':'
    maybe used instead of ' ', and ':', e.g. wythoff_2_4:3. The model
    is constructed directly from the symbol. Note that some degenerate
    snub models may not be constructed correctly. The faces around each
    triangle vertex are coloured, in order, red, blue, yellow, and snub
    triangles are coloured white.

o   u_ followed by a name (see the list below) Use '_' instead of
    a space to avoid having to quote the model name.

    When giving a name the following abbreviations can be used
       tr:     truncated
       sm:     small
       gr:     great
       st:     stellated
       sn:     snub
       tet:    tetrahedron
       ico:    icosahedron
       icosa:  icosahedron
       dod:    dodecahedron
       oct:    octahedron
       cubo:   cuboctahedron
       icosid: icosidodecahedron

    e.g. u_truncated_octahedron, u_tr_octahedron, u_tr_oct

o   Common polyhedra can be given by name only (see help for
    'common_polys' for list) e.g. tet, cube

o   Uniform prisms are named 'pri' followed by the polygon
    fraction e.g pri5, pri5/2

o   Uniform antiprisms are named 'ant' followed by the polygon fraction
    e.g ant5, ant5/2, ant5/3

======
Colouring a model usually involves specifying individual colours. A colour
can be specified directly in a number of formats, or can be the name of a
colour that Antiprism recognises, or can be an index number that will
generally be turned into a final colour by looking it up in a colour map.
Antiprism includes some colour maps, and facilities for creating new ones.

See these help topics for more details

   col_names :   colour names
   col_map :     colour map formats and resource colour maps)";

const char *help_color_val = R"(Colour Values
=============
Colour values may be given in a number of formats.

Red, Green, Blue and Alpha components (RGBA):
   3 or 4 decimal numbers separated by commas in the range 0.0-1.0
       (e.g. orange is '1.0,0.5,0.0')
   3 or 4 integers separated by commas in the range 0 - 255
       (e.g. orange is '255,128,0')
   x (or X or #) followed by 3 or 4 pairs of hexadecimal integers
       (e.g. orange is 'xFF8000', 'x' alone, is transparent black and is
        a shortcut for 'invisible')
Hue, Saturation, Value and Alpha components (HSVA):
   H or h, immediately followed by 3 or 4 decimal numbers separated by
   commas in the range 0.0-1.0. For initial h the hue has range
   0.0 to 360.0
       (e.g. orange is 'H0.07,1.0,1.0', or 'h25,1.0,1.0)
Colour name:
   Common colour names. See 'off_util -H col_names' for the full list.
       (e.g. 'orange')
Colour index:
   A positive integer that can be used as index into a colour map
       (e.g. '5'))";

const char *help_color_names = R"(Named Colours
=============

Colour names can be used to specify a colour given on the command
line or in a colour map file.

The names are those used in X11's rgb.txt. The list of colours is also
given in the Antiprism X11 colour map file included with the
resources. Other names: 'invisible' corresponds to transparent black,
and is used to indicate that display elements should be excluded from
display (a colour value of 'x' can also be used for 'invisible'); 'none'
is a colour with no colour data, setting an element to this colour removes
any colour data for the element (cannot be used in maps)

const char *help_ColorMap = R"(Colour Maps
===========
OFF elements may be coloured by index numbers. Colour maps provide a
way to convert these index numbers into colour values and are used
in command options such as off_color -m, antiview -m and n_icons -m.

The maps may use the Antiprism colour map format, Gimp Palette format
or Fractint format. The Antiprism format has lines of the form
index_number = color_value # comment_text, e.g. '2 = 1.0,0.0,0.0 # red'
anything after # is a comment and ignored. Blank lines are ignored

A map may be given by several maps separated by ',' e.g. 'map1,map2'.
The maps are tried in order until a conversion is found for an index
number

Map modifiers
-------------
A map may be modified by remapping its own entries. The modifiers
can be given in any order but the general form is

   map_name+shift*step%wrap

Any index, idx, is mapped to the colour value with index
   wrap is 0:      shift + idx*step
   wrap is not 0: (shift + idx*step) % wrap   [where % is modulus]
The defaults are shift=0, step=1, wrap=0. If a bare % is given then the
the wrap value will be the largest index number in the map plus one
e.g. cmap+1  : for index 10 get the colour value for cmap index 11
     cmap*2  : for index 10 get the colour value for cmap index 20
     cmap%6 : for index 10 get the colour value for cmap index 4

Resource Maps
-------------
Internal (see below for format):
   spread
      Gives a range of colours each differing from the last few. Useful
      to colour elements whose index numbers have been set sequentially.
   map
      makes a colour map on the command line. Map entries are separated
      by ':' and each entry corresponds to a line in an Antiprism format
      map. Colours given by components may also have the components
      separated by '/' (as spaces will require quoting or escaping).
      Does not accept a map size parameter.
   rnd, rand, random
      A random map, with colours selected within certain ranges
      (default: component ranges H0:1S0.7:1V0.7:1).
   rng, range
      A map made by ranging between component values
      (default: size 256, component ranges H0:1S0.9V0.9).
   index, remap
      Maps index numbers to index numbers. An index number is mapped to
      the same number processed by the map modifiers. Does not accept a
      map size parameter.
   reverse
      Maps index numbers to index numbers. The map reverses the order
      of a sequence of index numbers, such that the numbers in a
      specified range are mapped onto the same numbers in reverse order.
      Takes one or two parameters (default: reverse256)
        reverseN   - reversal that maps 0 onto N-1 (reverses a map of size N)
        reverseI:J - reversal that maps I onto J (reverses a custom range) 
   null
      An empty colour map. Does not accept map modifiers or a map size
      parameter.
   deal
      Maps index numbers to index numbers. The map (default: size 256)
      contains a random shuffle of the values 0 to packsize-1, packsize
      is the same as size by default, but can be changed by adding _packsize
      (sequential deals are used if this is less than size), e.g. deal100,
      deal_3
   grey, greyw
      greyscales (default: size 256), grey runs from black to white
      and greyw is wrappable and runs from black to white to black again.
   rainbow
      A seven color rainbow map (default: size 256), which include a brightness
      _value range from -1 (all black) to 1 (all white), e.g. rainbow_0.5
   uniform
      used to colour the uniform, Johnson and polygon-based resource
      models (applied with off_color -f A -m uniform)
   compound
      used to colour the uniform compound resource models (applied
      with off_color -f K -v F -e F -m compound)

   Maps often used in programs can also be for use to color indexed models with
   off_color or antiview.

   colorful
      primary and secondary colors. spread map is appended
   ghart
      color map that George Hart used in an online conway notation program.
      See the Antiprism conway program for details. spread map is appended
   kaplan
      an estimated color map that Craig Kaplan used in a paper presenting
      the symmetro program. See Antiprism symmetro program for details.
   axes
      four primary color to color the three axes of faces in the Antiprism
      symmetro program and to color the three types of axes in the Antiprism
      off_color_radial program.
   circuits
      a map of two shades of gray to color circuits in the Antiprism n_icons
      program. spread map is appended
   convexity
      a map of shades of three shades of gray to color convexity in various
      Antiprism programs.

   These maps contain a mapping for every index number (except default for
   rng is 256 entries). Follow the map name immediately by a number to set
   a particular size for the map (e.g. rnd64). The random and range maps
   (with the optional size specification) can be followed by '_' and then
   a letter from HSVA or RGBA (upper or lower case) to specify a component.
   This is followed by floating point numbers numbers separated by ':'.
   These numbers must be in the range 0.0 to 1.0. H may be larger than
   1.0 to allow hue ranges that cross the 1.0/0.0 boundary. Lower case 'h'
   gives the hue in the range 0-360. The random map allows one number for
   a fixed value, or two numbers for a range. The range map places the
   components at equal steps throughout the map and interpolates between
   the values
   e.g. rnd - default random map
        rnd64 - random map with 64 entries
        rnd256_S0V0:1 - random map with 256 grey entries
        rng - default range map, like a rainbow map with 256 entries
        rng16 - rainbow map with 16 entries
        rng_S0V0:1 - greyscale with 256 entries
        rng_R0:1:1G1:1:0B1:0:1 - runs from cyan to yellow to magenta.

External (in resource directory 'col_maps'):
   x11 (549 colours)
       Broad range of named colours from X11's rgb.txt. The names may
       also be used to specify colours on the command line.
   vga (16 colours)
       Original VGA named colours.
   html (140 colours)
       Broad range of colours. These are the colours that can be used
       by name in HTML.

       A colour map based on the Microsoft colour dialog.
   iscc (267 colours)
       Colour centroids (http://tx4.us/nbs-iscc.htm)
   spectrum (401 colours)
       An approximate visible spectrum

Color maps defined in alt_names.txt (in resource directory 'col_maps')

These color maps are of fixed size. To create a similar map with fewer color
entries, the step operator can be used. e.g. pastel*320 give 7 colors. Wrapping
is done using the index% modifier. e.g. index%7,pastel*320, would wrap these
seven colors. To wrap the entire map would be done as index%2240,pastel.

   pastel (2240 colours)
       A rainbow map, with lighter colors
   darkened (2240 colours)
       A rainbow map, with darker colors

const char *help_symmetry = R"(Symmetry
========
Several programs have features involving symmetry:
   poly_kscope - repeats a model symmetrically, used to make compounds
   off_align - repeats a model symmetrically, used to augment polyhedra
   off_trans - aligns a model according to symmetry
   off_report - prints symmetry information for a model
   off_color - colours by symmetry orbit
   antiview, off2vrml, off2pov - displays symmetry elements

The program option parameters are organised around the following ideas

  Symmetry group
    A set (group) of (Euclidean) transformations that carry a
    polyhedron onto itself, described in general form using
    Schoenflies notation (see below) e.g. Oh, D3v.

  Full symmetry group of a polyhedron
    The set of all (Euclidean) transformations that carry a
    polyhedron onto itself.

  Symmetry subgroup, or subsymmetry
    A set of transformations from a symmetry group which, considered
    alone, also form a symmetry group, e.g. a cube has Oh symmetry
    and has a 3-fold axis corresponding to a C3v subgroup.

  Symmetry orbit of an element
    A set of equivalent elements, those elements that this element is
    carried on to by a symmetry or subsymmetry of the model.

  Standard alignment of a symmetry
    A symmetry group could be aligned anywhere in the coordinate
    system, but there are particular alignments that fit nicely
    with the coordinate axes, and these are used as the 'standard'
    alignments in Antiprism. They are a way of associating a symbol
    like D3v with a fixed set of transformations.

  Conjugation subtype of a subsymmetry
    This is an integer used to distinguish subgroups which are
    not carried onto each other (by conjugation) by the
    transformations of the parent symmetry group. For example a
    cube has a 2 fold axis through mid-edge and a 2-fold axis
    through a face centre. There is no symmetry of the cube that
    carries one onto the other and so they will have different
    subtype numbers. Geometrically, they look different in the cube.

  Symmetry realignment
    If you align a polyhedron with the standard set of symmetries
    for its full symmetry group there is often more than one
    distinct way to achieve this (a transformation not in the
    symmetry group that transforms the symmetry group onto
    itself). For example, if you align a cereal box-like cuboid
    naturally with the coordinate axes there are 6 possibilities
    i.e. the centres of the three rectangle types can lie on any
    of the axes, with 3x2x1 = 6. Possibilities for some polyhedra
    are infinite e.g. the symmetry group of a pyramid does not change
    when it is translated along its principal axis. The realignment
    is given by a series of colon separated numbers, the first
    number selects from a finite set of realignments, and the
    following numbers are decimals to control rotations and
    translations as follows
      axial rotation:    1 number  - degrees around principle axis
      full rotation:     3 numbers - degrees around x, y and z axes
      axial translation: 1 number  - distance to translate along principal
                                     axis
      plane translation: 2 numbers - distance to translate along two
                                     orthogonal directions in (mirror) plane
      full translation:  3 numbers - distance to translate along x, y and z
                                     axes

  Schoenflies notation
    Used to specify symmetry groups. The standard alignments have,
    preferentially, a centre (fixed point) on the origin a principal
    rotational axes on the z-axis, a dihedral axis on the x-axis, a
    mirror normal on the y-axis (except Cs has a mirror normal on the
    z-axis). The polyhedral symmetry types have a 3-fold axis on (1,1,1).
    In the following list of symbols, when a type contains 'n' this must
    be replaced by an integer (giving an n-fold axis), and for S this
    integer must be even.
         C1  - identity
         Cs  - mirror
         Ci  - inversion
         Cn  - cyclic rotational
         Cnv - cyclic rotational with vertical mirror
         Cnh - cyclic rotational with horizontal mirror

const char *help_schwarz = R"(Schwarz triangles
=================
A Schwarz triangle, aligned with with the corresponding minimal symmetry
group, can be specified as follows:

schwarz_ followed by the three fractions separated by spaces or '_'. The
fractions are in the form used in the Wythoff symbol. If a triangle has
an angle of PIn/d, its fraction is d/n, e.g. the Mobius triangle for
octahedral symmetry has angles PI/2, PI/3 and PI/4 and is given by
schwarz_2_3_4, a spherical tetrahedron face has angles of 2PI/3 and is
given by schwarz_3/2_3/2_3/2. Add 'p' to repeat the triangle to make a
polyhedron, e.g. schwarz_5_3_2p.)";

const char *help_expreval = R"(Expression Evaluation
=====================
Any program that accepts a floating point argument will also accept the
argument as a mathematical expression. This expression will be used to
calculate a numeric value, that will then passed to the program.

Several of the characters that can appear in an expression may be
intercepted by the shell for its own use, and the expression will
often need to be enclosed in quotes, e.g.

   off_trans -T '1+sqrt(2)',0,0 cube

Arithmetic operators, + - * / ^, may be used, and various functions,
including: sqrt(), sin(), cos(), tan(), asin(), acos(), atan(), deg().
The full list of functions is included further below.

The following constants are defined: convenience square roots of the
form rt2, rt3, rt5, etc, pi = 3.14159..., phi = (sqrt(5)+1)/2 = 1.61803...

A limited set of variables, var0, var1, ...var9, may be used in
expressions (default value 0.0). Assign a value to a variable with
'=', and separate sub-expressions with ';'. The result of the last
sub-expression is returned as the result of the whole expression.

Examples:
   Expresion                  Result
   1                            1.0
   1+1                          2.0
   1+2*3                        7.0
   (1+2)*3                      9.0
   sin(30)                      0.5
   deg(pi/3)                   60.0
   sum(1;2;3)                   6.0
   var0=2;var1=3;var0^var1      8.0


The code that handles the expression evaluation is muParse, written
by Ingo Berg: http://muparser.beltoforion.de/ . The following is from
the muParser project documentation (with slight changes):

Built-in functions

Built-in binary operators
The following table lists the default binary operators supported by the
parser.

   Operator  Meaning                   Priority
   =         assignment (*see below)   -1
   &&        logical and                1

   <=        less or equal              4
   >=        greater or equal           4
   !=        not equal                  4
   ==        equal                      4

   */        division                   6
   ^         raise x to the power of y  7
*The assignment operator is special since it changes one of its "
arguments
and can only by applied to variables.

Other operators
muParser has built in support for the if then else operator. It uses
lazy evaluation in order to make sure only the necessary branch of the
expression is evaluated.
