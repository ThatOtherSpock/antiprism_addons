.SH NAME
off_color - add colours to an OFF file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B off_color
[\fI\,options\/\fR] [\fI\,input_file\/\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Read a file in OFF format and add colours to it. If input_file is
not given the program reads from standard input.
.PP
A colour value can be a single integer (a colour index), a value in
form 'R,G,B,A' (3 or 4 values 0.0\-1.0, or 0\-255) or hex 'xFFFFFF', a
colour name from the X11 colour map, 'invisible' or 'none' (which sets
without any colour information)
.PP
Lowercase letters (except l) colour using index numbers and uppercase
letters colour using colour values. Symmetric colourings are optionally
followed, separated by commas, by a subsymmetry (Schoenflies notation)
and a conjugation type (integer). Adjacent element colourings FEV are
processed after other element colourings, and in the order \fB\-f\fR, \fB\-e\fR, \fB\-v\fR.

\fB\-l\fR <file> lights for colouring type L in a file in OFF format, each
.IP
vertex and its colour gives a light direction and colour
(default: a set of six lights giving a rainbow colouring)
.HP
\fB\-m\fR <maps> a comma separated list of colour maps used to transform colour
.IP
indexes (default: spread), a part consisting of letters from
v, e, f, selects the element types to apply the map list to
(default 'vef').
.HP
\fB\-r\fR <rnge> Map HSVA values onto the specified HSVA ranges after other
.IP
processing (but before \fB\-I\fR), component letters are followed by
one or two values separated by a colon e.g H0.5:0.8 followed by
a comma and elements to map from v, e, f (H0:1S0:1V0:1A0:1,vef)
.HP

.IP
elements to map are from v, e and f (default none)

.HP
\fB\-U\fR <typs> colour only elements with particular current colour types:
.IP
u \- unset, i \- indexed, v \- visible colour value, x \- invisible.
