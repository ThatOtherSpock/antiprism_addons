<h2><a name="resources">
Antiprism Resources
</a></h2>

Antiprism includes a number of resources, which are either internal
or external. Internal resources are accessed by name and are generated
by Antiprism. External resources are support files distributed with
Antiprism. They are actual files and can be accessed directly. They are
useful as examples and as a starting point for creating new resources.
<p>
Nearly all the resource files may be used, modified and redistributed
without restriction (check the begining of each resource file for details.)
<p>
Please,
<a href="mailto:<<EMAIL>>">send me</a>
any resources that you create and would like to share with other
Antiprism users.

<h2><a name="usage">
Accessing the Resources
</a></h2>

If Antiprism has been installed then the external resources
are automatically available by their names. The resource names
are case insensitive. If Antiprism is not installed then
set the <tt>ANTTIPRISM_DATA</tt> environment variable to
point to the <tt>share</tt> directory of the Antiprism distribution.
<p>
How to set this variable will depend on your system.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Example DOS command
    <pre>set ANTIPRISM_DATA="c:\some\dir\antiprism-0.xx\share"</pre>
<li>Example bash command
    <pre>export ANTIPRISM_DATA="/home/user/antiprism-0.xx/share"</pre>
</ul>

Otherwise, the resource files are just ordinary files so simply
give the full path to the resource you want to use.
<p>
When you specify a filename the program will look for the file
in three places in this order
<ol>
<li>The current working directory
<li>The relevant directory in <tt>ANTTIPRISM_DATA</tt> (if set)
<li>The relevant directory in the installed data directory (if installed)
</ol>
A data directory may include a file called <tt>alt_names.txt</tt>. This
contains a list of alternative names for the files in that particular
data directory. The resource name is searched for in the alternative
names if it does not refer to a file in the directory. The format is
<tt>alt_name = file_name</tt>.

<h2><a name="models">
Models
</a></h2>

<b>Directory:</b> <tt>models</tt>
<p>
Internal model resources include
<ul>
<li><i>Platonic, Archimedean and other Uniform polyhedra</i>
    (see <tt>off_util -H uniform</tt>)
<li><i>Johnson polyhedra</i>
    (see <tt>off_util -H johnson</tt>)
<li><i>Polygon-based polyhedra such as prisms, antiprisms,
pyramids, dipyramids, cupolas, orthobicupolas, gyrobicupolas and
snub-antiprisms</i>
    (see <tt>off_util -H polygon</tt>)
</ul>
<p>
The resource directory includes 
<a href="http://polytope.net/hedrondude/polyhedra.htm">
Bower's short names</a> for the uniform polyhedra.

<h2><a name="cmaps">
Colour Maps
</a></h2>

<b>Directory:</b> <tt>col_maps</tt>
<p>
OFF elements may be coloured by index numbers. Colour maps provide
a way to convert these index numbers into colour values. As well as
the Antiprism colour map format the progams also understand
<i>Gimp Palette</i> format and <i>Fractint</i> colour maps. Colour
maps are used by <i>off_color -m</i>,  <i>antiview -m</i>,
<i>n_icons -m</i> and other programs.
See <tt>off_util -H col_map</tt> for a full list of the internal and
external colour maps available with Antiprism.
<p>
More colour maps are available from
<a href="http://www.iosart.com/firefox/colorzilla/palettes.html">
Colorzilla Palettes</a>.

<h2><a name="lights">
Lights
</a></h2>

<b>Directory:</b> <tt>col_lights</tt>
<p>
Lights are OFF files whose vertex elements are coloured. These
colours are taken as lights in the direction of the vertices,
and are used to colour the elements of other OFF files. Lights
are used by <i>off_color -l</i>.

<dl>
<dt><i>default</i>
<dd>Red, green and blue opposite their complements on the vertices of
    an octahedron. This makes a rainbow effect on a sphere, and is
    the default lighting in <i>off_color</i>.
    <p>
<dt><i>lg3d</i>
<dd>Lighting similar to LiveGraphics3D lighting effect.
    <p>
<dt><i>rgbw</i>
<dd>Red, green, blue, and white on the vertices of a tetrahedron.
    <p>
<dt><i>pastel</i>
<dd>Like <i>default</i> but using pastel colours for a softer rainbow
    effect.
</dl>

<h2><a name="incs">
POV-Ray Include Files
</a></h2>

Antiprism will convert OFF files to POV-Ray format. The POV-Ray file
is written in such a way that much of the final presentation can be
modified after the file is written. One way to override the defaults
and preset values is with POV-Ray include files. POV-Ray include files
are used by <i>off2pov</i>. See especially
<a href="off2pov.html#struct">POV-Ray file structure</a>.
<p>
Some include files have user configurable variables. These are
described at the start of the file. They can be set in several ways -
<ul>
<li>on the POV-Ray command line, if the variable holds a floating point e.g.
    <pre>povray Declare=some_val=1.0 file.pov</pre>

<li>in another include file, which is included earlier. It may be
    convenient to create the file on the command line e.g.
    <pre>echo "#declare some_tex=texture{T_Brass_4A}"&gt;default_pov.inc &amp;&amp; povray file.pov</pre>

<li>in the include file itself, which should be copied elsewhere and the
    modifications applied to the copy.
</ul>

<dl>
<dt><i>rot90.inc</i>
<dd>faces are converted to a ring around the face normal at the centroid,
    struts lead to the face's edge centres. Edges are convverted to a
    ring around the edge at the edge centre.
</dl>

<h2><a name="extras">
Extras
</a></h2>

The extra resources are unsupported, and provided for interest only.
They may be useful as examples. Programs or scripts may require
modification before they will work. For further details see the
<a href="extras_readme.html">Extras README</a> file.
