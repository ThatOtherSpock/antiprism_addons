.SH NAME
off_sym - Add visual symmetry elements to an OFF file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B off_sym
[\fI\,options\/\fR] [\fI\,input_files\/\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Add visual symmetry elements to an OFF file as seen in antiview.
Note that any off file viewer must be able to handle invisible elements
invisible is defined as rgba = (0,0,0,0). Elements should be hidden with
off_sys rather than the viewer because the symmetry elements are made of faces
